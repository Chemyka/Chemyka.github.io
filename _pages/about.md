This blog is designed to inspire an appreciation for the
techniques, applications, and peculiarities of quantum computational chemistry,
particularly through open-source demonstration. As of the 19th March, 2020, the project is still under active development. It is run anonymously as a labor of love, in my spare time.

## Blogroll

I am hardly the first to create a chemistry blog. Here is a collection
of active(-ish) blogs I've found. Feel free to let me know if I'm missing any!
